# paper_playground

Welcome to **Paper Playground**! This repository is dedicated to **reproducing and experimenting with code from research papers** in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

## 🧠 **Purpose**
- Reproduce implementations from DL/RL research papers.  
- Validate results and explore variations.  
- Gain a deeper understanding of complex architectures and algorithms.

## 📚 **What You'll Find Here**
- Code implementations of papers in NLP, DL, and RL.  
- Clear explanations and comments on tricky parts of the implementation.  
- Comparison of reproduced results with original findings.

## 🚀 **Goals**
- Make complex research papers more accessible through code.  
- Build an organized archive of reproducible experiments.  
- Encourage learning through hands-on implementation.

## 📂 **Project Structure**
- `neural_probabilistic_lm/`: Implementation of "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model".  
- `attention_is_all_you_need/`: Reproducing the Transformer architecture.

## 🤝 **Contributions**
Feel free to suggest papers, raise issues, or submit pull requests to improve clarity and correctness.
